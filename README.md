Go Project

My First project on Go I created in a day!

So, if you want to run it, you have to download Golang tools/needed settings from the official website(https://go.dev/dl).

Then, you should download this repository using this command: git clone https://github.com/TimurAkramov/Go-Project.git

After this, if you want to run this server and see what will happen, type on your cmd/terminal this: go run main.go

As written port in main.go (":8081") you should type in search line on your browser this: localhost:8081(you can chang the port)

If you want to end the process/server, you should paste: ctrl + C.
